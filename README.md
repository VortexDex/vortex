# V-Engine zkSNARKs Smart Contracts

This repository contains a collection of smart contracts designed for zkSNARKs-based Layer-2 scaling solutions on Ethereum and other compatible blockchain networks. These contracts enable secure, transparent, and efficient off-chain transactions while leveraging the power of zero-knowledge proofs for privacy and scalability. ABased on the PLONK proving system, our solution provides Spot trading, Perpetual trading, DeFi, NFTs (Non-Fungible Tokens), and cross-chain functionality.

## Overview

Scalability and privacy concerns continue to hinder widespread blockchain adoption. zkSNARKs (Zero-Knowledge Succinct Non-Interactive Argument of Knowledge) are a cryptographic technique that allows a prover to convince a verifier of the validity of a statement without revealing any information about the statement itself. By integrating zkSNARKs into Layer-2 solutions like zk-rollups and zk-sidechains, we can address current blockchain limitations and develop more efficient and secure systems.

## Introduction
